# Steering GPT2 using SAE latents: Packerchat

I steered gpt2 using an SAE latent that corresponds to the Green Bay Packers and the NFL. I then deployed it on Google Cloud. 

For the **frontend**, I used typescript + react. 

For the **backend**, I used python and fastAPI. 

For the **infrastructure**, I used terraform for IaC and GCP's Cloud Run for serverless deployments.
