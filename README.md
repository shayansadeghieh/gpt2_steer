# Steering GPT2 using SAE latents: Packerchat

Within this repo, I steered gpt2 using an SAE latent that corresponds to the Green Bay Packers and the NFL. 

For the frontend, I used typescript + react. 
For the backend, I used python and fastAPI. 
For the infrastructure, I used GCP and serverless. The backend is deployed on GCP.
